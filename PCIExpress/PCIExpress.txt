1. LTSSM 
(Based on Section 4.2.4 Link Initialization and Training, LTSSM is performed by Physical Layer Logic Block aka PCS)

Discovered and determined
  -> Link width, Link data rate, Lane reversal, Lane  polarity
Training does
  -> Link data rate negotiation
  -> Bit lock per lane
  -> Lane polarity
  -> Symbol lock or Block alignment per Lane
  -> Lane ordering within a link
  -> Link width negotiation
  -> Lane-to-Lane de-skew within a multi-Lane Link

2. Transaction Layer
Four Address Spaces defined : Memory, I/O, Configuration, Message
